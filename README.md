Viper Engine is an modular game engine designed with data driven and component based approach.

This project is my personal project to learn game engine programming and architecture. The project will be constantly updated while I learn game engine programming at FIEA and possibly even after I graduate.

This is just a basic skeleton of the project as of now and I am in the process of filling the individual projects with implementations regularly.
